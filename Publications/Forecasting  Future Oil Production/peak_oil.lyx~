\begin_layout Abstract
\noindent
We have developed a Monte-Carlo methodology to forecast the crude oil production
 of Norway and the U.K.
 based on the current/past performances of individual oil fields.
 By extrapolating the future production of these fields and the frequency
 of new discoveries, we are able to forecast the oil production of these
 countries.
 Our results indicate that standard methodologies tend to underestimate
 remaining oil reserves.
 We compare our model to those methodologies by making predictions from
 various points in time the past.
 It shows that our model gives a better description (hopefully soon) of
 the evolution of the oil production.

 Forecasting future oil production has been a topic of active interest since
 the beginning of the past century because of oil's central role in our
 economy.
 Its importance ranges from energy production, through manufacturing to
 pharmaceuticals industry.
 Petroleum is a non-renewable, finite resource.
 It is primordial to be able to forecast future oil production since a misestima
tion of its reserves can have huge consequences on our society.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 The methodology behind forecasting future oil production has not evolved
 much since M.
 King Hubbert who, in 1956, famously predicted that the U.S.
 oil production would peak around 1965-1970.
 That prediction has proven itself to be correct.
 His main argument was based on the finiteness of oil reserves and use of
 the logistic differential equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dt}=rP\left(1-\frac{P}{K}\right)\label{logistic}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
to model oil production.
 The logistic differential equation is characterized by an initial exponential
 growth, which then decreases to zero as the total oil extracted reaches
 saturation (no more oil is to be found).
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is commonly referred to as the growth rate, and 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 as the carrying capacity (total quantity of oil extracted).
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $P(t)$
\end_inset

 is the the amount of oil extracted up to time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dP}{dt}$
\end_inset

 is the oil production rate, the quantity that M.
 King Hubbert predicted with surprising accuracy to peak.
 From a methodological point of view, the Hubbert model has enjoyed a longstandi
ng popularity in modeling future oil production given its simplicity.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 In this paper, we introduce a new methodology to forecast future oil production.
 Instead of taking the aggregate oil production profile and fitting it with
 the Hubbert curve or its variants (such as the multi cyclic Hubbert curve),
 we use the production profile of each individual oil field.
 By extending their production into the future and extrapolating the future
 rate of discovery of new fields, we are able to forecast future oil production
 by the means of a Monte Carlo simulation.
 To demonstrate the universality of the methodology presented here, we apply
 it to 2 major oil producing countries with publically available data: Norway
 and the U.K.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea behind the methodology is to model the future aggregate oil production
 of a country by studying the production dynamics of its individual constituents
, the oil fields.
 The main benefit of this approach, compared to working directly with aggregate
 production data, is the possibility to forecast non-trivial oil production
 profiles arising from the combination of all the individual fields' dynamics.
 In order to achieve that, one must be able 1) to 
\series bold
extend the oil production of each individual field
\series default
 into the future and 2) to 
\series bold
extrapolate the rate of discoveries
\series default
 of new oil fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Extending the oil production of individual fields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step to predicting the future oil production of a country is to
 extrapolate the future production of existing fields and to estimate the
 error on this extrapolation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Regular, irregular and new fields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be able to forecast the oil production of each individual field, regularity
 needs to be found in the production's dynamics.
 Modeling the whole production profile from the beginning of extraction
 seems elusive due to the variety of the forms it can take.
 Fortunately, modeling the decay process is sufficient in order to extrapolate
 future oil production.
 A preliminary classification is necessary to achieve that goal.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "regular_and_irregular"

\end_inset

 shows that independent of the country, oil fields can be classified into
 3 main categories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Regular fields
\series default
 - Their decay show some regularity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Irregular fields
\series default
 - The ones that don't decay in a regular fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
New fields
\series default
 - The ones that don't decay yet.
 As such, there is no easy way to forecast their future oil production based
 on past data.

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
All the fields have been fitted using an automated algorithm, afterwards
 the results have been checked visually to sort out the irregular fields
 which could not be fitterd.
 As of January 2013, regular fields make up 85% and 87% of the number of
 fields and 94% and 71% of the total produced oil volume in the Norway and
 the U.K.
 respectively.
 As such, being able to model them is crucial.
 As can be seen on figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "regular_and_irregular"

\end_inset

, the stretched exponential (equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "stretched_exponential"

\end_inset

) is a good functional form to fit the decay process of regular fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(t)=P_{0}e^{\left(\frac{t}{\tau}\right)^{\beta}}\label{stretched_exponential}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the minority of irregular fields, we simply modeled their decay as follows.
 We picked 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 to be the average 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 over the regular fields.
 We then fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 so that the sum of the fields' production over its lifetime be equal to
 the official ultimate recovery estimates, when such an estimate is available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minority of new fields will be treated as a new discovery, as their
 final size can simply not be predicted based on the existing production
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Back-testing & Error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine how well the extrapolation based on the stretched exponential
 predicts the future production, a complete back-testing has been performed
 on each field.
 A single back-test is made as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The production data 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{0},\,\ldots,\, p_{N}\}$
\end_inset

 of the field is truncated at a certain date in the past 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in\{0,\,\ldots,\, N\}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The extrapolation is made based on the truncated data 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{0},\,\ldots,\, p_{t_{0}}\}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The future production predicted by the extrapolation 
\begin_inset Formula $f(t)$
\end_inset

 can be compared to the actual production from the date in the past up to
 now 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{f}=N$
\end_inset

.
 This allows us to compute the resulting error in the extrapolated total
 production
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{e}(t)=\int_{t}^{t_{f}}f(\tau)d\tau
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the error
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
e(t)=\frac{P_{e}(t)-\sum_{i=t}^{t_{f}}p_{i}}{P_{e}(t)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

as a function of the truncation time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Repeating such a back test for every possible date in the past, allows us
 to plot the evolution of the error over time.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the complete back-test, on can compute the average error 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{e}$
\end_inset

 the extrapolation made on the future production and the standard deviation
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset

 from the average error.
 As the average error is often fairly constant, the extrapolation was corrected
 by the average error.
 Meaning that if the extrapolation consistently over-estimated the production
 by 10% during the back-test, the extrapolation was reduced by 10%.
 This results in an extrapolated production 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

, including a 1
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 confidence interval, as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(t)=(1-\bar{e})\, f(t)\pm\sigma_{e}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of such an extrapolation including a one standard deviation range
 is shown on figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "regular_and_irregular"

\end_inset

 for the field Oesberg.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Aggregate error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we have extrapolated all the individual fields, the aggregated extrapolatio
n for the country has to be computed.
 While this is straightforward for the expected production, some care has
 to be taken with respect to the error on the production at the country
 level.
 As shown later, the same extrapolation including a complete back-test has
 been performed at the country level and the resulting error is much smaller
 than the average error observed on an individual field.
 To account for this observation, the necessary assumption is that the error
 between the individual fields is largely uncorrelated.
 Therefore, the fields can be considered as a portfolio of stocks with an
 underlying trend but an overlayed random walk.
 This means that the error at the country level from the extrapolated production
 is to be computed as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{country}^{2}=\frac{1}{\#fields}\sum_{field\in fields}\sigma_{field}^{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As example, a country with 100 fields having each an error of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm50\%$
\end_inset

, will have an expected error of only 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm5\%$
\end_inset

.
 Intuitively, this results from the fact that the uncorrelated errors among
 fields cancel out on average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Discovery rate of new fields
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Discovery-rate-of"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowing the future production rate of existing fields is not enough as new
 fields will be discovered in the future.
 The model describing the discovery rate of new fields should satisfy two
 fundamental observations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The rate of new discoveries should tend to zero as time goes to infinity.
 This is a consequence of the finiteness of the number of oil fields.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The rate of new discoveries should depend on the size of the oil fields.
 As of today, giant oil fields are discovered much less frequently than
 dwarfs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Discoveries modeled as logistic growth
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Discoveries-modeled-as"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A natural choice for such a model is a non-homogenous poisson process.
 The Poisson process is a process that generates independent events at a
 rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 It is inhomogeneous if the rate is time-dependent, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\rightarrow\lambda(t)$
\end_inset

.
 The standard way to measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda(t)$
\end_inset

 is to find a functional form for 
\begin_inset Formula $N(t)$
\end_inset

, the number of events (discoveries) up to time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda(t)$
\end_inset

 is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dN(t)}{dt}$
\end_inset

.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "rate_of_discovery"

\end_inset

 shows 
\begin_inset Formula $N(t)$
\end_inset

 for Norwegian fields classified according to their size.
 The logistic curve is a good fit to the data (integral form of equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "logistic"

\end_inset

).
 This implies that after an initial increase, the rate of new discoveries
 reaches a peak followed by a decrease until no more oil fields are to be
 found, consistent with our fundamental observations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The larger an oil field is, the easier it should be discovered and the more
 profitable its production will be.
 Therefore, it is expectable that the large oil fields have all been found,
 and that future discoveries will mostly be made up of dwarf fields.
 For the purpose of this model, the fields have been split into two groups:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Dwarfs
\series default
: Fields which are smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $1/10^{th}$
\end_inset

 of the largest existing oil field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Giants
\series default
: Fields which are larger than
\series bold
 
\series default

\begin_inset Formula $1/10^{th}$
\end_inset

 of the largest existing oil field.

Logistic fit to the number of discoveries for Norway.
 The discovery rate of new oil fields is dependent on their size.
 The logistic model suggests that a large number of dwarf oil fields has
 not yet been discovered, while the rate of discovery of giant oil fields
 is almost zero.

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting plot shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "rate_of_discovery"

\end_inset

 confirms our hypothesis.
 Giant oil fields are mostly all found while the discovery process for dwarf
 fields is still ongoing.
 The logistic growth curve fit to the giant discoveries is stable, however
 the fit for the dwarfs is unstable.
 As can be seen on figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "rate_of_discovery"

\end_inset

, the carrying capacity 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 of the logistic growth model is not well constrained by the available data.
 A large spectrum of values for 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 leads to a good fit to the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Likelihood function for the number of discoveries
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To overcome the logistic fitting issue for the dwarf fields, a method already
 used by Smith 1980 has been implemented.
 This method makes the following two postulates:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The discovery of reservoirs in a petroleum play can be modeled statistically
 as sampling without replacement from the underlying population of reservoirs.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The discovery of a particular reservoir from among the existing population
 is random, with a probability of discovery being dependent on reservoir
 size.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fields are splitted into 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 size bins denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1},\,\ldots,\, S_{J}$
\end_inset

 occuring with frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1},\,\ldots,\, n_{J}$
\end_inset

.
 Each discovery is considered as a step 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at which a field of size 
\begin_inset Formula $I(i)\in\{S_{1},\,\ldots,\, S_{J}\}$
\end_inset

 is found and we will denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{ij}$
\end_inset

 the number of fields of size 
\begin_inset Formula $j\in\{1,\,\ldots,\, J\}$
\end_inset

 discovered before the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 step.
 Than the probability that the discovery at step 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 is of size 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P\left(I(i)=S_{j}\right)=\frac{\left(n_{j}-m_{ij}\right)\cdot S_{j}}{\sum_{k=1}^{J}\left(n_{k}-m_{ik}\right)\cdot S_{k}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The likelihood 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 for a complete sequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 discoveries 
\begin_inset Formula $\{I(1),\,\ldots,\, I(N)\}$
\end_inset

 can than be expressed as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L=\prod_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\left(n_{I(i)}-m_{iI(i)}\right)\cdot S_{I(i)}}{\sum_{j=1}^{J}\left(n_{j}-m_{ij}\right)\cdot S_{j}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The unknown parameters are the number of fields 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1},\,\ldots,\, n_{J}$
\end_inset

, whose likelihood can now be estimated based on the existing discoveries.
 Using a brute force approach, the entire space of plausible values for
 the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1},\,\ldots,\, n_{J}$
\end_inset

 has been sampled.
 The values 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{j}$
\end_inset

 have been sampled between the number of existing fields 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{Nj}$
\end_inset

 in the bin 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and up to a value 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{j}^{upper}$
\end_inset

 such that the most likely scenario 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{j}^{max}=n_{j}^{upper}/2$
\end_inset

.
 Subsequently, the likelihood of each scenario (value of the tuple 
\family roman
\series medium
\shape up
\size normal
\emph off
\bar no
\strikeout off
\uuline off
\uwave off
\noun off

\begin_inset Formula $n_{1},\,\ldots,\, n_{J}$
\end_inset

) has been normalized such that the total likelihood of all generated scenarios
 equals one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the analysis of the north sea oil field discoveries, the number of size
 bins has been fixed to 
\begin_inset Formula $J=2$
\end_inset

 splitting between dwarfs and giants as described section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Discoveries-modeled-as"

\end_inset

.
 The results are coherent with the intuitive expectation that discovering
 a new giant field is unlikely and that the future discoveries of dwarf
 fields can only be constrainted to a range as presented on figure

The method described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Likelihood-function-for"

\end_inset

 yields probabilities for the total number of fields (including the not
 yet discovered fields) in each size bins (called a scenario).
 However, this likelihood method does not give the time distribution of
 future discoveries.
 The aim is to use the likelihood function to generate scenarios with their
 respective occurence probability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a given scenario, the carrying capactiy 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 (= total number of fields) is given for each size class.
 This is useful, because it resolves the instability in fitting the logistic
 curve to the number of discovered fields.
 The time distribution of the discoveries is then given for each size class
 by the fitted logistic curve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The actual size of a newly discovered field is generated according to the
 size distribution of the existing fields in its size class.
 The probability distribution function of field sizes in a given size bin
 has been fitted by an exponential function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The production curve is computed based on the average production curve of
 all existing fields in the same size category.
 The production curves of the existing fields have all been normalized to
 a total production of one and then been averaged.
 This yields an average production curve including a one standard deviation
 error.
 For a new field, this average production curve is than multiplied by the
 size of the field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Superposing the production curves results in the expected production curve
 from future oil field for a given scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the total parameter space is too large to be sampled entirely, a Monte
 Carlo technique is applied to compute the expected production from future
 discoveries and standard deviation.
 In a nutshell, the algorithm works as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Draw a scenario based on its probability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Compute the time distribution of new discoveries by fitting a logistic curve
 for each size class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For each discovery generate a size and the resulting production curve based
 on the size distribution and production curves of existing fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Superpose all the production curves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Repeat and average over all drawn scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result is the expected production curve of future oil field discoveries.
 The distribution between all the generated scenarios yields the confidence
 interval.

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the methodology described in section

, simulating future oil production was straightforward.
 For each country, the existing fields were extrapolated and the future
 discoveries were simulated.
 Figure

 shows the average of 1000 simulations.
 For each country, we can immediately notice the non-symmetric shape of
 the production's dynamics contrary to what Hubbert would have predicted.

\begin_layout Standard
The difference between our and the Hubbert-based forecast is striking.
 In the case, of Norway, the standard Hubbert model was used to fit the
 production data.
 According to it, Norway's future oil production would decay much faster
 than in the Monte-Carlo case.
 As such, the estimated remaining reserves are less than one third of the
 forecasted value of the Monte-Carlo methodology.
 In the U.K., oil production faced a change of regime during the early nineties
 due to technological innovation, giving rise to the inverted "w shape"
 of the oil production profile.
 The standard procedure to model oil production in those cases is to use
 a multi-cyclic Hubbert curve.
 The multi-cyclic Hubbert model is a generalization of the standard one.
 Conceptually, it is just a superposition of several standard (single-cyclic)
 Hubbert curves.
 Two cycles are commonly used to fit the UK's oil production.
 The difference between the Hubbert-based methodology and the Monte-Carlo
 one is very similar to the Norwegian case.
 The former underestimates the remaining oil reserves by about 
\begin_inset Formula $70\%$
\end_inset

 compared to the latter.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Which of the two models is more thrust worthy? Clearly, the implications
 in adopting one methodology over the other are significant.
 The only way to answer this question is to backtest them.
 In other words we ask: "What would have each of the models predicted had
 we used them 10, 15, 20 years in the past?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Validation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each of the three countries, namely Norway, the U.K.
 and the U.S.A., we went back in time 10, 15 and 20 years respectively.
 The reason for chosing an earlier starting point for our backtest in the
 case of the U.S.A.
 compared to say, Norway has to do with the number of oil fields available
 at the time of the backtest.
 The U.S.A.
 having the biggest number of oil fields, we could chose an earlier starting
 point without compromising the quality of our results.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "bt"

\end_inset

 shows the outcome of those tests.
 In the case of Norway, the production data was taken into account until
 2003.
 Comparing the forecast of both models with the oil production of the subsequent
 10 years, we find the predictive power of the Hubbert model is impressive.
 It perfectlty captures the Norwegian oil production's dynamic between 2003
 and 2013.
 The Monte-Carlo method does not perform as well.
 After underestimating the Norwegian oil production between 2003 and 2009,
 it overestimates it between 2009 and 2013.
 For the U.K.
 the backtesting was performed on data until 1998.
 The conclusion is not as obvious as for the previous case.
 None of the two methods captures perfectly the oil production between 1998
 and 2013.
 The following table summarizes the difference between the two models.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have presented a Monte-Carlo based methodology to forecast future oil
 production.
 By extending the oil production of current fields into the future and modeling
 the discovery rate of new fields, we were able to give forecasts on the
 future oil production of Norway, the U.K.
 and the U.S.
 These forecasts offer significantly scenarios from the ones obtained with
 standard Hubbert-based methodologies.
 Indeed, our model gives a 3 times superior estimation of the remaining
 oil reserves than the standard one.
 However, our backtesting results seriously questions the credibility of
 that forecast, since the Hubbert-model clearly outperforms the Monte-Carlo
 simulation.
